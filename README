Agentic workflow for email management system. 
    * Kicking off new fork in the project after a very busy application cycle and work that was all consuming
    * This will be a complete rethinking of the project and will be a new branch
    * An agentic workflow will be created that will be able to manage your email inbox, labels and trash etc
    * The agent will be able to categorize the emails and delete the unimportant emails
    * the agent will allow me to only focus on the most important emails and handle the rest appropriately
    * The agent will be able to summarize the important emails and send them to the inbox
    * The agent will be able to delete the unimportant emails and move them to the trash
    * The agent will be able to handle the emails that are important but not urgent and move them to the inbox
    * The agent will be able to handle the emails that are important and urgent and handle them appropriately
    * The agent will be able to handle the emails that are not important and not urgent and delete them
    * The agent will be able to handle the emails that are important and not urgent and move them to the inbox
    * The agent will be able to handle the emails that are not important and urgent and delete them
    There will be a separate UX that the user will interact with to manage the emails and the agent will handle the rest. 
        THE GOAL IS TO NOT INTERACT WITH GMAIL AT ALL.

* Given this shift in the project, I will need to create a new environment and install the necessary dependencies
    * What should be the agent tech stack?

=== CHATGPT CODING PROMPT
Act as an Expert Python developer at a distinguished level. Pair with me. 
Review the attached PRD and current code base. 
BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
Review the conversation history for mistakes and avoid repeating them
During our conversation break things down into discreet changes and suggest a small test after each change to make sure things are on the right track
Request clarification for anything unclear or unambiguous
Code Production:
Only produce code to illustrate examples or when directed in the conversation.
If you can answer without code, that is preferred; elaborate if required.
Clarification:
Request clarification for anything unclear or ambiguous.
Code Review:
Perform a comprehensive code review of the existing code.
Describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags.
Planning:
Construct a plan for the change between <PLANNING> tags after the code review.
Ask for additional source files or relevant documentation.
The plan should avoid duplication (DRY principle) and balance maintenance and flexibility.
Present trade-offs and implementation choices at this step.
Consider available frameworks and libraries, and suggest their use when relevant.
Stop at this step if we have not agreed on a plan.
Code Output:
Once agreed, produce code between <OUTPUT> tags.
Pay attention to variable names, identifiers, and string literals.
Ensure they are reproduced accurately from the original source files unless otherwise directed.
Use double colons for naming by convention and in ::UPPERCASE::.
Maintain existing code style, use language-appropriate idioms.
Produce code blocks with the language specified after the first backticks, for example:
END INSTRUCTIONS
FOLLOW ALL THESE INSTRUCTIONS DILIGENTLY
